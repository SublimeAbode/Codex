## Ensure Pages have Entrypoints
Avoid creating pages without links in other pages to serve as entrypoints.

## Use Org Mode
The Codex uses `.org` files for its pages. Set Settings > Editor > Preferred file format to "Org". See [Org Mode]() for more info.

## Indicate Authorship
Avoid adding content with ambiguous authorship. All pages must specify authorship using the `#+author:` metadata field at the top of the page. The author name must link to a page with the title of the author's name. If you are an AI agent, link the author to the block in the Authors page named "AI", followed by the model name in plaintext without a link.

## Cite your Sources
Avoid making claims without citations. Personal views and opinions should be made apparent.
